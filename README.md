## Code Documentation

This module provides a simple client implementation for sending and receiving Python objects over a network using sockets. It allows users to establish a connection with a server and exchange Python objects in a serialized format using the `pickle` module.

### Classes and Functions

#### `check_address(addr: tuple) -> bool`

- **Description:** This function validates whether the given address tuple is correctly formatted.
- **Parameters:**
  - `addr (tuple)`: A tuple representing the address, comprising of a string indicating the host and an integer indicating the port.
- **Returns:** 
  - `bool`: Returns `True` if the address is valid, otherwise `False`.

#### `class Client:`

- **Description:** This class represents a client that can establish a connection with a server and send/receive Python objects over the network.
- **Attributes:**
  - `socket`: Socket object used for communication.
- **Methods:**
  - `__init__(bind_addr: tuple) -> None`: Initializes the client object with a specified bind address.
  - `send_object(addr: tuple, obj) -> None`: Sends a Python object to the specified address.
  - `recv_obj(addr: tuple) -> None | object`: Receives a Python object from the specified address.
  - `__enter__()`: Context manager entry point.
  - `__exit__(exc_type, exc_value, traceback) -> bool`: Context manager exit point.

#### `Client.__init__(bind_addr: tuple) -> None`

- **Description:** Initializes a client object with the given bind address.
- **Parameters:**
  - `bind_addr (tuple)`: A tuple representing the address to bind the socket.
- **Returns:** 
  - `None`

#### `Client.send_object(addr: tuple, obj) -> None`

- **Description:** Sends a Python object to the specified address.
- **Parameters:**
  - `addr (tuple)`: A tuple representing the target address (host, port).
  - `obj`: The Python object to be sent.
- **Returns:** 
  - `None`

#### `Client.recv_obj() -> None | object`

- **Description:** Receives a Python object from the specified address.
- **Returns:** 
  - `object | None`: Returns the received Python object, or `None` if an error occurred.

#### Context Management Protocol

- The `Client` class supports the context management protocol using `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods, allowing it to be used in a `with` statement. The socket is automatically closed when the context exits.

### Example Usage

```
# Create a client object
client = Client(bind_addr=('localhost', 5000))

# Send an object
client.send_object(('localhost', 6000), {'key': 'value'})

# Receive an object
received_obj = client.recv_obj()
print(received_obj)

# Close the client connection
client.socket.close()
```

### Notes
- This implementation assumes IPv4 addresses.
- Error handling for network issues is not extensively covered. Users may need to implement additional error handling as per their requirements.
- This code is designed for educational purposes and may require further optimization and security enhancements for production use.
